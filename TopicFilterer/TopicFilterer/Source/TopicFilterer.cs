He told me his friend was Muslim but he was really cute and my friend figured we’d hit it off despite slight religious/ cultural differences. We’ve been talking for a week now and last night we met in person. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the conversations we had was about halal/ eating pork/ drinking alcohol. Whilst he doesn’t eat pork at all, he drinks alcohol and eats McDonald’s/ shake shack/ whatever. When I asked him why he doesn’t eat pork he just told me it’s personal preference NOT that he avoids it for religious reasons. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am really into this guy and wanted to make an amazing first impression, so figured I’d make one of my go to all out meals that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; loves which was slow cooked bourbon pork butt sliders with a homemade slaw. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When he came over it was amazing, he was cute, funny, and really chill. He drank the beer I offered him, and when we sat down to eat I told him that we’d be having bourbon sliders. I didn’t mention it was pork because in our conversations he told me that he’d never intentionally eaten it before but if he did he didn’t think he’d like it so I didn’t want him to be biased. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After he took a couple bites he looked at me with a really pissed off face and asked if it was pork. I said yes, and he just spat out his mouthful into a napkin and in a really angry voice said that he thought he’d told me he didn’t eat pork. I told him that I thought I’d change his mind and he said that wasnt a cool thing for me to do. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He left very quickly after and I was so upset I called my friend who initially set us up. He was really pissed at me even though I defended myself on the phone and said that a) my date drank alcohol and didn’t eat halal anyway so how I was meant to know that he took not eating pork seriously and b) he didn’t make it clear he avoided pork for religious reasons. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All my guy friends have texted me today saying variants of ‘yo that was mad dumb of you lmao’ etc and I just feel really upset about the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/metalsirens&quot;&gt; /u/metalsirens &lt;/a&gt; &amp;#32; to &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/&quot;&gt; r/AmItheAsshole &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c43tcx/aita_for_cooking_my_muslim_date_non_halal_meal/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c43tcx/aita_for_cooking_my_muslim_date_non_halal_meal/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_c43tcx</id><link href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c43tcx/aita_for_cooking_my_muslim_date_non_halal_meal/"" /><updated>2019-06-23T12:25:31+00:00</updated><title>AITA for cooking my Muslim date non halal meal after he said he doesn’t eat halal? my friends think I’m a major ass.</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/DmarZX</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/DmarZX</uri></author><category term=""interestingasfuck"" label=""r/interestingasfuck""/><content type=""html"">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/c48iwk/this_is_zeus_the_rescued_blind_owl_with_stars_in/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/eDs6Wyss2F3rYJ1PA4rBptzMzVjAi1KSNl0KZrwi4xI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;This is zeus.

So last week I found a thong on the floor in my living room. Smelt it like the animal I am, was clean, and put it in my wife&amp;#39;s underwear drawer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2 days ago in the evening, my wife is getting ready to go take a bath, when she comes down 2 minutes later asking me where the hell does this thong come from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Huh... I found it on the floor, surely it felt from the laundry basket? It was clean so I put it in your drawer. What it&amp;#39;s not yours?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Angrily, she answers it&amp;#39;s not hers. You just want me to believe it just appeared on the floor?!?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tell her what the hell am I suppose to say. She goes back upstairs really angry at me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So last week my wife was out of town for work and a female friend of mine came take a beer with me. I send her a picture of the thong, asking if it hers. It is. We&amp;#39;re both a bit confuse as to how it ended in my living room... We came to the conclusion maybe it got stuck at whatever she was wearing that night by static electricity while it was in the dryer...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the real fuck up. My wife is in the bed. I go tell her that my friend was here last week to take a beer. Just texted her and the thong is hers. The only explanation we managed to find it&amp;#39;s that it was stuck by static at her clothes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE THAT?! THAT MAKES NO SENSE&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ, I don&amp;#39;t even believe my explanation myself. I tell her to believe what she wants, I don&amp;#39;t fucking know how the thong appeared in my living room, that I don&amp;#39;t have anything to redeem myself. I take some clothes and go sleep at my parents&amp;#39; home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next morning she calls me. She tells me that she decided to believe in my stupid story, because the thong was indeed clean and it&amp;#39;s logical that I&amp;#39;d put it in her drawer. And if I was cheating on her, I&amp;#39;d be fucking stupid to put my mistress panties in her drawer. Asked me to come home and we laughed a lot after that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TLDR : Found my friend&amp;#39;s thong on the floor in my living room, put it in my wife&amp;#39;s underwear drawer. Almost lost my wife to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT : OMG it exploded. Thanks for the silver mystery redditors! I know a bunch of you called me a liar and a cheater, that&amp;#39;s ultimately your right! Had fun with the others that told similar stories :) And yes, I told my friend that I sniffed her panties, asked her what her fabric softener was.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT2 : The &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/KtGzDeU&quot;&gt;thong&lt;/a&gt; in question&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT 3 : Wow thanks for the gold! I answered to a bunch of you, but I&amp;#39;ll not be able to keep up! There&amp;#39;s too many comments! I hope you guys have a nice day!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT4 : addressing some comments. No I don&amp;#39;t think my friend did it on purpose to have my wife divorce me so she can have me all for herself. Yes I have the right to see other women and have a drink with them. My wife also has the right to see other men and have a drink with them. Finally, my friend&amp;#39;s fabric softener is Fleecy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/hymness1&quot;&gt; /u/hymness1 &lt;/a&gt; &amp;#32; to &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/&quot;&gt; r/tifu &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c43efz/tifu_by_putting_a_thong_that_was_not_my_wifes_in/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c43efz/tifu_by_putting_a_thong_that_was_not_my_wifes_in/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_c43efz</id><link href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c43efz/tifu_by_putting_a_thong_that_was_not_my_wifes_in/"" /><updated>2019-06-23T11:53:10+00:00</updated><title>TIFU by putting a thong that was not my wife's in her underwear drawer</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/notoriousdob</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/notoriousdob</uri></author><category term=""RoastMe"" label=""r/RoastMe""/><content type=""html"">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/c436v6/40_year_old_make_up_artist_do_your_worst/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Fn2h-uK7usFOnQvmM4gq9yTPg3P-CTS-8ttO7HOIIYE.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;40 year old make up artist.

Apparently all titan supers have really bad hit detection, which makes no sense especially on console, were you always see a titan whether void, arc or solar always get 3-4 kills easily. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You have a super with high resilience that can not only shut down other supers, but then have the super energy remaining to pick up a few other kills. If you play comp you’ll quickly realise that the meta is striker Titan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then you have hammers which is great as you don’t need to get close to an opponent to get a kill. Shield is the same except you can block incoming damage and no scope three people with a ricocheting shield. Titans easily have the best supers right now across any class. Yet somehow Titans who don’t even what setup to use to get grenade kills in iron banner, think they’re underpowered and need a buff. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only buff you need is PVE wise. Something to increase the damage on Thundercrash and something to increase the effectiveness of Ward of Dawn. I think we can all agree on that. But pointlessly saying that OEM is the only exotic that makes Titans viable in PvP is stupid, or saying how suppressor grenades are pointless because you are stuck using a void subclass which is somehow weak and further reinstating the fact that striker titan is a easy to counter super and is no where near the best. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TLDR; It is obvious that Titans need PVE buffs but stating that they are weak in PVP is just stupid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/SuperPaki&quot;&gt;

This happened a few times over the next 18 months In this time we probably spent more time apart than together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We knew early on that we wanted different things, and while marriage and kids are something I would want further down the line, I wasn&amp;#39;t concerned about his open dislike of marriage and kids because 19 is too young to get married anyway. If I were dating him 10 or 15 years from now and he didn&amp;#39;t want to get married, then I might have an issue, but when I&amp;#39;m barely out of my teens, it&amp;#39;s not a huge concern, and just loving him and wanting to be with him is enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I went to see him this time I was again, considering breaking up with him. Aside from the long term issues, he is also inconsiderate and has a mean streak that I really don&amp;#39;t like. So when I arrived at his place, mentally debating breaking up with him for good this time, and he told me he wanted to take me out to dinner, I assumed he wanted to break up too, publicly so I wouldn&amp;#39;t cause a scene. I don&amp;#39;t normally cause a scene but being in public tends to prevent yelling, and we both yell every time we break up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the last year he has asked me 2 things that looking back now stand out to me. First he asked about jewellery, what kind of stuff I liked and what my taste was. I assumed it was because my birthday was coming up and he was getting me a bracelet or something so I told him simple and delicate, silver or steel rather than gold, if there was a colour then blue, nothing flashy or expensive as both my job prefers plain jewellery and it&amp;#39;s just my personal preference. I also said &amp;quot;go cheap&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other thing he asked me was how I felt about public proposals. I told him immediately that I, personally, disliked them as I felt I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to say no, even if I wanted to. I feel like public proposals are OK when they&amp;#39;ve been specifically requested and agreed on, but one that&amp;#39;s totally out of the blue is not OK at all. I assumed he was asking about this because his friend had just proposed to his girlfriend of several years, publicly, and she&amp;#39;d accepted but admitted to him after that she would have preferred something private.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I never thought in a million years that he would propose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So you can imagine my shock when we went to dinner and the first thing he did was propose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ring was huge, gold, gaudy, red gems around a diamond and the whole thing was the size and shape of a super bowl ring. He got on one knee, and held it out to me. We were in the middle of this popular restaurant and the place was packed. Everyone there could see what was going on and wasn&amp;#39;t even trying to hide that they were looking at us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I said no.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, I didn&amp;#39;t so much say &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;. I ran out of the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He drove me there, so I got a cab back, and drove home that night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I realise running out wasn&amp;#39;t the best thing to do but I didn&amp;#39;t know what else to do. I could feel everyone&amp;#39;s eyes on me, and all I knew was that I didn&amp;#39;t want to marry him or accept his proposal. I felt like I couldn&amp;#39;t even speak, I was so upset about the whole thing. So I just got up and ran.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just want to take the opportunity to say here that I really really don&amp;#39;t care about the rings. Honestly, when I want to get married (which is absolutely not when I&amp;#39;m 19 years old) the right person could just turn to me and say &amp;quot;wanna get married?&amp;quot; and I&amp;#39;d say yes. I wouldn&amp;#39;t even need a ring. I know I&amp;#39;m focusing on the ring and the public proposal a lot, but that&amp;#39;s only because of 1) how far away it was from what I&amp;#39;d told him my taste was and 2) what happened next.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t hear from him until a few weeks later. He said that he thought a proposal was something I&amp;#39;d want, but he saw now that it wasn&amp;#39;t. He said that he was out of pocket for the rings. He&amp;#39;d bought us both the same one and gotten them engraved. He linked me to the jeweller&amp;#39;s website and the ring was up for €1450 (about $1650/£1300). When I asked why he was telling me this he said that he&amp;#39;d hoped I would cover the cost of mine. He said that as they&amp;#39;d been engraved he couldn&amp;#39;t get a refund. He&amp;#39;d hoped that I would say yes to the proposal, in which case he wouldn&amp;#39;t have asked me to pay, but I said no. He also said I&amp;#39;d embarrassed him by saying no in public, and should have said yes, and if I was really against it waited to say no when we were alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We both live in small towns where gossip spreads at church. Enough people were at the restaurant that night that both of us got asked about it at church on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He has since messaged me saying he&amp;#39;s debating calling in a lawyer to sue me for the cost of my ring (€1450) and he also says that I have caused him &amp;quot;emotional distress&amp;quot; by turning him down in public, and have publicly humiliated him for both rejecting his proposal in public and leaving him to deal with church gossip, which I had no part in spreading. He says he can also get some money off me over those other 2 things. So €1450 for what he spent on my ring, and extra money for emotional distress and public humiliation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think his legal claims are all bullshit, and he wouldn&amp;#39;t have a leg to stand on in a court of law, but I am not a law student or a lawyer. He is studying law currently and has an internship at a legal firm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do I do about all of this? Do I need to prepare myself for a lawsuit or is it not even worth worrying about?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: He knew I wanted to get married but not to him. He not only knew this but said he had no intention of marrying me, either. He openly despised marriage right up until the time he proposed and he knows that we want different things out of marriage, and I told him that this was why I was breaking up with him the times before this that I have ended the relationship. During the course of our relationship he&amp;#39;s also said stuff like &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;re still too young to think about marriage&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not like we&amp;#39;re getting married&amp;quot; and (my favourite) &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;m gonna propose&amp;quot; (that one was last April)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Jenny86-75-309&quot;&gt; /u/Jenny86-75-309 &lt;/a&gt; &amp;#32; to &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/&quot;&gt; r/legaladvice &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c43tve/my_ex_proposed_i_said_no_he_is_now_talking_about/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c43tve/my_ex_proposed_i_said_no_he_is_now_talking_about/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_c43tve</id><link href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c43tve/my_ex_proposed_i_said_no_he_is_now_talking_about/"" /><updated>2019-06-23T12:26:42+00:00</updated><title>My ex proposed.
